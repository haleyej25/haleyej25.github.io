                <h3>Other Facts</h3>
                <p>The joke “finish the Dreadfort” is a 2018 meme that has followed our builder “Banty Rooster” from his former project, “The Crag” this joke has also crept up to annoy his co-leader SMP.
                All the torture mechanisms in the dungeon are historically accurate but one, can you guess which room?
