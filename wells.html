                <h3>Significant Canon</h3>
                <p>Wells is the seat of the Dornish noble house of the same name. The village and keep of House Wells are located in the dunes north of the Greenblood river. House Wells was formed by a family of Westerosi descent who were exiled from their home. Members of the house braved the Dornish sands and stumbled upon an oasis right as they were about to succumb to exhaustion and defeat. Here, the members of this house raised a keep and vowed to aid any poor souls who stumbled upon their oasis. Members of House Wells are considered to be Sandy Dornishmen. Their faces are burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. House Wells' sigil and words are unknown, but the builder of this project has chosen the bright and lush colors you see around the keep as a representation of this house.

                <h3>Other Facts</h3>
                <p>Construction for this build started on June 4, 2015 and ended on January 17, 2016. Building of Wells took a rather long time as the builder was currently in school and could not work on the project very often. However, when he did find time, he accomplished a lot in a short time. The current version of House Wells of Dorne replaces an older version built by a past builder by the name of 'dspa1r'.</p>
