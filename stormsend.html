                <h3>Significant Canon</h3>
                <p>Storm's End is the seat of House Baratheon, the Lords Paramount of the Stormlands and is located on Durran's Point on the northern coast of Shipbreaker Bay in The Stormlands. The kingsroad runs north from Storm's End to King's Landing through the Kingswood.
                Storm's End is considered one of the strongest castles in the Seven Kingdoms. It was once the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings of House Durrandon, and in the Dawn Age, Durran Godsgrief supposedly won the heart of Elenei, daughter of the sea god and goddess of the wind. The storm god retaliated by destroying the first six castles that Durran tried to build, until a young boy who grew to be called Bran the Builder, constructed the seventh version of Storm's End, which has stood against wind and rain ever since.

                <h3>Other Facts</h3>
                <p>In April 2013, Storm's End officially began using plans created by Feasting that included concentric circles and ovals. The outer wall was to be made of large fitted stones and sloped, so the base was wider than the walkways on the top. (See Forum) The castle is described very precisely in the books, and this canon informed the build. A timelapse video was created that shows the construction of the buildings inside the outer wall.</p>
