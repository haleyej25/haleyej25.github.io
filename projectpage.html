                <h3>Significant Canon</h3>
                <p>King's Landing is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and its second
                        largest city after Oldtown. The city was founded on the site where
                        Aegon I (Aegon the Conqueror) landed on the mainland of Westeros
                        from the Targaryen fortress on Dragonstone. What was once only
                        hills and forest became the center of politics, religion, and
                        trade on the continent in its three-hundred year history. The
                        population of King's Landing is estimated around a half million,
                        but swells during times of war when it is flooded with refugees.
