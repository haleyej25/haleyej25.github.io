                <h3>Other Facts</h3>
                <p>Griffin's roost has a long and troubled history on WesterosCraft having been built and rebuilt four times now. The original Griffin's Roost was a tiny castle, built in a time when the server's overall build quality was very crude. After some drama, the second one was built on an old map. Marken4 decided to rebuild it in it's current iteration. Unfortunately, Marken4 disappeared before he could finish the interiors of Griffin's Roost. It existed as just an exterior until January 2013 when LeonEuler decided to furnish the rest of it. SMP led the newest version of Griffin's Roost (often called "groost" by builders) in 2015 with the latest texture pack. Griffin's Town was made mostly by one person,and completed in about two weeks.
                    Progress remained stagnant until almost seven months later when it was finished in January 2016.
