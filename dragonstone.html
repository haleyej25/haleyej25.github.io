                <h3>Significant Canon</h3>
                <p>Dragonstone is a volcanic island near Blackwater Bay. The island was fortified
                    by the Targaryens when they left the Valyrian Freehold, and it was from Dragonstone that
                    Aegon the Conqueror began his invasion of Westeros. The active volcano called the Dragonmont
                    provided habitat for the Targaryen dragons throughout the centuries, and signs of their activity
                    still exist on the island. Traditionally, Dragonstone is the seat of the heir to the Iron
                    Throne. The castle was carved using ancient Valyrian magic
                    to look like intertwining dragons, a style of architecture that exists nowhere is Westeros since
                    the advanced techniques of masonry were lost in the Doom of Valyria. Since Robert's Rebellion,
                    the castle has been occupied by the Baratheons, with Stannis Baratheon being the current Lord
                    of Dragonstone.
