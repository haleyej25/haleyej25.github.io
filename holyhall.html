                <h3>Significant Canon</h3>
                <p>Holy Hall is the seat of House Graceford, a noble house from The Reach. It's location is directly north of Highgarden and its style heavily borrows from it's local design and architecture. The region is primarily agricultural with rolling fields of grain, crops, and orchards abound and great deals of blooming flowers bursting through the region.
                    Their sigil is with the Mother's face upon white pale wavy dividing a brown field. Their words are "Work Her Will".
