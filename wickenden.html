                <h3>Significant Canon</h3>
                <p>Wickenden, located on the Bay of Crabs in the southern region of the Vale, is the seat of House Waxley, a noble house sworn to the Arryns. Their arms display three candles, white with red flames and silver candle holders, on a grey background bordered with black. Their words are "Light in Darkness". Wickenden is hardly mentioned throughout the books, though they are known for being Westeros's main producter of scented beeswax candles. The current lord of Wickenden is Ser Edmund Waxley.

                <h3>Other Facts</h3>
                <p> WICKENDEN IS BEING REDONE FOR THE 4TH TIME AS OF THIS MOMENT.As the main inspiration for at least the keep, I used Neuschwanstein Castle, the quintessential model for most Vale castles, but of course with red rooves instead of blue ones. As for the village itself, I was aiming towards a quaint alpine Swiss village, such as one you would find in the foothills of the Alps. I combined this with a similar pallete to the keep itself, and that's where the inspiration for the town came from
                    Emot has also created a false legend of a hidden candle under the lands of House Waxley. It was done to tease and waste the time of gullible builders.
